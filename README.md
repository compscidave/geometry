A geometric library that computes the Voronoi diagram of a set of input points.

I converted this to Java in 2012 from a C++ project done during my undergrad.

The library includes a custom implementation of the Doubly Connected Edge List and Status Tree advanced data structures.

Perhaps someday I'll come back and clean up all the atrocious blunders I was un-aware of w.r.t. coding standards and best practices.
